However, comparative evaluation of such marketing data is extremely difficult due to differences in manufacturers' terminology and test methods. Standard test methods, such as the ASTM E28xx series can be used to provide objective and reliable data on robot capabilities. Responders can trust the data captured at any participating accredited test facility, no matter when or where the testing was conducted. ""Home-grown"" performance specifications often result in requirements that compete or conflict with each other. This has consistently led either to inadequate performance, excessive cost, or both. Purchasers should make purchasing decisions by specifying available combinations of robotic capabilities as defined in standard test methods that reflect their envisioned mission tasks. Responder robot test methods have been (and continue to be) developed by DHS S&T/NIST/ASTM, including tests for capabilities specific to counter-IED operations involving packages, personnel, and vehicles. A suite of standard test methods has been published through the ASTM International Committee on Homeland Security Applications; Operational Equipment; Robots (E54.08.01), and additional standard test methods are published yearly. Purchasing organizations should require that candidate robot manufacturers have their robots evaluated according to the applicable ASTM standard test methods, and require that each manufacturer provide a copy of the completed test method charts indicating how the robots scored in the requested suite of tests.","Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program (IPR), Intercity Bus Security Grant Program (IBSGP), Port Security Grant Program (PSGP), State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP), Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP), Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI)"

The key component is a balloon filled with lighter-than-air gas that enables the system to take flight and remain aloft. These balloons, usually referred to as envelopes, come in different shapes, sizes, and designs, which are determined by mission, payload, and logistical factors. Other components typically include: - A means for transporting the system, such as a truck and/or trailer; - A mooring station for controlling the inflated aerostat envelope prior to launch; - A launching platform, which sometimes doubles as the mooring station; - Tethers used for both mooring the aerostat envelope to ground equipment and for transmitting power and data; - Winches for letting out, pulling in, and adjusting the tension of the tethers; and - Automatic or manual deflation devices. Depending upon the mission, tethered aerostats can support a variety of surveillance and tactical equipment. This item also includes mission-specific payloads that are designed to be attached to the tethered aerostat platform. Examples include, but are not limited to, high-resolution video cameras, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, communication/network repeaters, acoustic detectors, and radar.
