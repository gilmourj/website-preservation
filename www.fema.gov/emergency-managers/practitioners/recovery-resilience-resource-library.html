      <p>FEMA developed the Recovery and Resilience Resource Library in collaboration with our federal interagency partners to navigate the numerous programs available to the United States and its territories to help recover from a disaster.</p>
<p>The resources are intended for state, local, territorial and tribal (SLTT) governments, as well as nonprofits, businesses, healthcare institutions, schools, individuals and households. The tool helps users to find and research federal disaster recovery resources that would be beneficial in pre-disaster recovery planning or in the wake of a disaster.</p>
